        <h2 id="left">What is mental health?</h2>
        <p id="right">Mental health is an important aspect of our overall health and well-being.
            According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.), it includes our emotional psychological,
            and social well-being. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2020), it affects how
            we think, feel, andnact.
            It determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions.
            Mental health and physical health go hand-in-hand in contributing to one’s overall health.</p>

    <article class="myths">
        <h2>Common Myths and Misconceptions</h2>
        <h3>Myth 1: "Mental health problems are rare."</h3>
        <p>According to (Dattani et al., 2021), as of 2017 10.7% of the worldwide population has some type of mental
            health disorder.
            This means that about 1 in 10 people have mental health conditions. We should not discriminate against them
            because they are more common than we think.</p>

        <h3>Myth 2: "Mental health conditons are a sign of weakness."</h3>
        <p>Just like physical health conditions, mental health conditions are not a sign of weakness.
            Like with physical health conditions, people with mental health conditions need to seek proper help and
            treatment.
            According to (SA Health, 2021), they can be caused by genetic, biological, social and environmental factors.
            A personal mental health condition is often a result of circumstance, not personal character flaw.</p>

        <h3>Myth 3: "People with mental health conditions are violent/dangerous"</h3>
        <p>For the majority of those with mental health conditions, they have a higher risk of being victims than
            abusers.
            Yes, some people with mental conditions can be more violent than the general population, but they are the
            minority.
            This is usually seen in individuals with a combination of a very severe mental health illness, a substance
            use disorder, and an antisocial personality disorder (Newman, 2020).</p>

        <h2 id="left">Breaking the Stigma</h2>
        <img src="../images/stigma.png" alt="many hands pointing at a girl">
        <div>
            <p>The stigma around mental health leads to discrimination. It has a lot of negative effects for those with
                mental health conditions.
                It can deter them from asking for help and treatment. They can be discriminated against by the people
                around them.
                It can make them feel or seem guilty for their condition. This could even lead to worsening of their
                conditions.
                Breaking the stigma will normalize the topic of mental health and remove the negative discrimination
                against a community that is already facing enough problems.</p>
            <h3>What can you do?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Educate yourself and others.</li>
                <li>Talk about mental health equally as physical health.</li>
                <li>Share your experiences.</li>
                <li>Show mental health as a spectrum.</li>
