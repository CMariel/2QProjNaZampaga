        <h2 id="left">Getting a Proper Diagnosis</h2>
        <img src="../images/consult.png" alt="consulting with a doctor">
        <p id="right">Knowing the warning signs and symptoms will help you recognize and be aware of your personal
            mental health and those around you.
            Getting a proper diagnosis is the most important step in a treatment plan because it starts the whole
            journey to a better state of mental health.
            If you exhibit some of the warning signs and symptoms, do not be afraid to ask for help and guidance.
            Same goes for someone you know, help them because you might not know how much it will mean for them.
            Some people are just scared to ask for help. There are many resources to starting your journey of seeking
            professional help and guidance.</p>

    <article class="content self_diagnose diagnose">
        <h2 id="right">Dangers of Self-diagnosing</h2>
        <p id="left">It is good to be aware your mental health, but self-diagnosing is not advisable since it is
            potentially dangerous (Thatcher, 2021).
            Self-diagnosing can lead to under playing some symptoms or over exaggerating others.
            It can lead to more anxiety about your condition since you can over-diagnose.
            You might think you have many conditions but in actuality, all your symptoms fit under one condition.
            You could also diagnose yourself with something more severe than what you are actually experiencing
            which can downplay the experience of people that actually have that condition.
            You might also try to cure yourself with medication you donâ€™t actually need.
            Overall, recognizing and acknowledging your symptoms is important but diagnosing is such a complex task,
            so it is better to seek the help of actual professionals before falling into a spiral of searching all your
            symptoms.</p>
